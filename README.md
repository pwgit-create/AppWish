## AppWish Quick Start Guide:
Follow these simple steps to get started with AppWish:

### 1. Set up your OPENAI API key:

## Make sure you have the OPEN AI KEY
* [Video instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVog4J6nIAU)
* [Web instructions](https://www.howtogeek.com/885918/how-to-get-an-openai-api-key/)

#### On Linux
Add your OPENAI API key as an environment variable by executing the following command in the terminal:
```export OPENAI_TOKEN=YOUR_KEY```
#### On Windows (extra steps included)
Add a new environment variable for your user called OPENAI_TOKEN and use your OPENAI API key as value
See article from howtogeek for more information: https://www.howtogeek.com/787217/how-to-edit-environment-variables-on-windows-10-or-11/

### 2.1 (only windows) Enable running unsigned scripts. 
      
      2.1.1 Start Windows PowerShell with the "Run as Administrator" option
      2.1.2 Enter: set-executionpolicy remotesigned in the console
      
      Note: This is needed for allowing the powershell compile script to execute if 
      script running is disabled. It will allow local scripts to be run but 
      not remote ones (on your computer):

### 2. In your terminal, use the following command to start the application:
#### On Linux: ```make run```
#### On Windows( powershell or cmd): ```make run-win```


### 3. Once the application is running, you'll find a text box provided.
Write down the desired features and specifications for your application in the text box.
Generate your application:

### 4. After defining your application features, click on the "Create" button.
With these steps, you'll be on your way to generating your desired application using AppWish. Get ready to witness the magic of turning your ideas into reality!

Note: Make sure to replace "YOUR_KEY" in Step 1 with your actual OPENAI API key for successful integration.

## Discover the Path to Your Generated App Folder!
Exciting news! The apps generated by App Wish are now conveniently saved in a designated folder. You can find them at the following location: 
#### On Linux: ```AppWish/AppWish/src/main/resources/java_source_code_classes_tmp```
#### On Windows ```AppWish\AppWish\src\main\resources\java_source_code_classes_tmp```
But that's not all. App Wish goes the extra mile by allowing you to run these applications directly within the platform, provided there are no input parameters required. Simply click on the class file and watch your app come to life!

However, in cases where input parameters are necessary, manual execution is required. Don't worry, it's a straightforward process. All you need to do is run the class file manually, ensuring that you provide the required input parameters.

App Wish empowers you to explore, test, and refine your apps effortlessly. Take advantage of the generated app folder path and the flexibility of running your applications either within the platform or manually with input parameters.

Let your apps shine and showcase their full potential with App Wish!

Note: It's important to review the generated code and perform necessary modifications, if any, before running the app. Additionally, make sure you have the required dependencies and configurations in place for seamless execution.

## Unlock the Power of External Libraries for Your App Wishes!
Imagine a scenario where your app wishes are granted with incredible code, but you encounter a small hurdle - some of the required libraries don't exist in your current environment. Don't worry, we've got you covered!

App Wish provides a seamless solution to this challenge. If the generated code relies on non-existing libraries, you can easily incorporate them externally by downloading the necessary JAR files from the trusted Maven Repository. Once downloaded, simply add these libraries to your classpath, and watch your app come to life!

To assist you further, we've prepared a helpful video tutorial. It guides you through the process of adding external libraries and ensuring they seamlessly integrate into your project. Check out the following link to access the video and learn how to effortlessly overcome this obstacle:
