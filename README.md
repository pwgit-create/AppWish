## Discover the Path to Your Generated App Folder!
Exciting news! The apps generated by App Wish are now conveniently saved in a designated folder. You can find them at the following location: 
```AppWish/AppWish/src/main/resources/java_source_code_classes_tmp```

But that's not all. App Wish goes the extra mile by allowing you to run these applications directly within the platform, provided there are no input parameters required. Simply click on the class file and watch your app come to life!

However, in cases where input parameters are necessary, manual execution is required. Don't worry, it's a straightforward process. All you need to do is run the class file manually, ensuring that you provide the required input parameters.

App Wish empowers you to explore, test, and refine your apps effortlessly. Take advantage of the generated app folder path and the flexibility of running your applications either within the platform or manually with input parameters.

Let your apps shine and showcase their full potential with App Wish!

Note: It's important to review the generated code and perform necessary modifications, if any, before running the app. Additionally, make sure you have the required dependencies and configurations in place for seamless execution.
